4.1    This is a pure Python script which chooses some rectangle in the complex plane, colors that rectangle according
       to the Mandelbrot method, and saves the coloring as an image.
       
4.2    Its the same program as 4.1 except to make the program faster, numpy is used from python module

4.3    Its the same program as 4.1 except to make the program much faster, numba is used from python module

4.5    This program provide a command line user interface for the scrips that is make in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 .
      It provides instructions for its by calling it with a --help
      
4.6   This is a simple setup script for the package that was created. The package is called mypackage and it 
      includes a method called mandelbrotcompute.py. when checking if the set is doing what it was supposed
      to do, one has to test it by typing  setup.py bulid
      
      This program has also a unit test where it tests when the given region are outside and inside of the
      Mandelbrot set region after 0 iterations. pytest is used in this
      program so inorder to see if the program passes or fails one has to type pytest test_mandelbrot.py -v
